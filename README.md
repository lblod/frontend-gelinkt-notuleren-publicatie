# frontend-gelinkt-notuleren-publicatie

Frontend of the publication pages generated by gelinkt notuleren.

## Setting up the backend

Information on setting up the backend can be found at https://github.com/lblod/app-gn-publicatie

## Running the frontend

We advise the use of [edi](https://github.com/madnificent/docker-ember) but have chosen to include the default ember commands to limit confusion.

First make sure you have ember-cli installed

    npm install -g ember-cli

Next we clone this repository, install the dependencies, and boot the development server

    git clone git@github.com:lblod/frontend-gelinkt-notuleren-publicatie.git
    cd frontend-gelinkt-notuleren-publicatie
    
    # install the dependencies
    npm install
    
    # run the development server
    ember s --proxy http://localhost

You can visit the live reloading site at http://localhost:4200

## Configuration via docker environment variables
This frontend can be configured at runtime. It will get the environment variables prefixed by EMBER_ and match them with the variables defined in the frontend's configuration. When the docker container is started it will update /app/index.html to match the provided configuration.

### other
* `EMBER_ENVIRONMENT_NAME`: name of the environment, appended to the document title.
